\usage{
add_comma_space(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The text variable.}
}
\value{
Returns a vector of strings with commas that have a space after them.
}
\description{
Adds a space after a comma as \code{strip} and many other functions may consider a 
comma separated string as one word (i.e., \code{"one,two,three"} becomes 
\code{"onetwothree"}  rather than \code{"one two three"}).
}

x <- c("the,  dog,went", "I,like,it", "where are you", NA, "why", ",", ",f")
